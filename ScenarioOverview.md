# Assignment #1: Getting Organized  
## Preparing for the Initial Client Meeting  

### Scenario Overview  

The following issues are being faced by the client, a pet daycare:

1. Owners are frustrated because it takes at least three months to onboard new hires.
2. Employee Dissatisfaction: Onboarding new clients is a challenging process, and every employee has a unique "flavour" while dealing with them.
3. Customers' annoyance: It's hard to follow the onboarding process.

The objective is to break down the requirements, prepare questions, and outline preliminary tasks in order to be ready for the first meeting with the client.
